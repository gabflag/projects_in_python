# projects_in_python

The codes and annotations present in this repository are exclusively for Python applications.
I have separated the present codes by a file system, I hope that this way it will be easy to understand and search.
As for the content, most of them are basic codes, however, I feel that I got rich in producing them. I hope it gives you a similar experience.
